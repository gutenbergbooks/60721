  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The impetus given to improvements in sanitary
matters by the conferences held during last year at
the Health Exhibition, as well as the desire shown
by engineers and others to improve the sanitary
condition of towns, has induced me to publish the
following system of detecting defects in drainage
and sanitary fittings.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must be admitted that grave errors have been
committed by engineers, architects, and builders,
both in planning the fittings of houses and in
laying drains to the main sewers, during the last
twenty years. These errors have been found to
have produced serious effects on the public health.
They have also been the means of establishing
throughout the country a number of Sanitary
Protection Societies.</p>

<p class='c006'>These institutions have been the means of saving
many useful lives, but I trust that the day is not far
distant when these societies will cease to exist, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>such terms as “scientific plumbers” and “sanitary
arrangements carried out on the most scientific
principles” will be a thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c006'>To my mind it is a national disgrace to know that
in this nineteenth century architects and builders
fixed fittings to houses, and laid drains from houses
to sewers, which affected the health of the occupants
to such an extent that it was necessary to establish
insurance offices to protect persons from being killed
by workmen or their employers. What a page for
future historians!</p>

<p class='c006'>The work or purpose of drains and sanitary fittings
is to carry off by water the soil and dirt from our
houses, and it is lamentable to think that this cannot
be done without injury to life.</p>

<p class='c006'>What should we say if the same precautions were
necessary to test or examine the work of other professions
or trades?</p>

<p class='c006'>To many the system described in these pages may
appear new, but it is by no means so, as it was discovered
and used by me in 1880, and was then the
means of finding out serious defects in a supposed
perfect drainage system.</p>

<p class='c006'>From that time up to the present it has proved of
considerable value in determining any defect in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>construction of drains and fittings. With the
detector and anemometer I have been enabled to
discover the cause of so many failures in sewer ventilation,
and to trace the origin and transmission of
many cases of zymotic disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>The object of this work is to place the same
knowledge in the hands of every person connected
with sanitary work.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>“Bad Drains.” How often has this term been used
during the last few years? By the medical profession
alone, thousands of cases have been attributed
to this cause. To the honour and credit of that
profession its members have thought out and worked
out the cause of innumerable cases of disease under
their charge, and rightly fixed their origin to be due
to “bad drains.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In many cases it has been but a fashionable term
to describe cases which had the appearance of gas
poisoning, but did not owe their origin to drains;
but rather to the heated and impure atmosphere of
rooms, late hours, and the sudden change from heat
to cold. If there have been a few hundred cases
where “bad drains” were supposed to have caused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the illness and such was not the case, there have
been thousands of others where the disease originated
from them, but was taken as a matter of course,
or as one of the frailties of the human frame, when
undoubtedly the cause was “bad drains.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a most remarkable thing, that whilst on the
one hand we have the medical profession energetically
working to find out defects in the planning
of drains and sanitary fittings, and writing articles
on them, we have on the other hand surveyors and
others who have treated the matter as a doctor’s fad.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the last five years scarcely a medical conference
has been held without the question of “bad
drains” forming one of the principal subjects discussed.
Medical officers of health have made stirring
speeches and reports to Local Boards; but where is
the surveyor who has had the energy to do the same
unless it has been actually forced upon him? It is
a curious but noteworthy fact, that nearly the whole
of the evils of badly constructed drains, and the principal
improvements in them, have been forced on
surveyors, builders, and plumbers by the medical
profession and the public.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reticence shown by surveyors in dealing with
“bad drains” may be attributed to their unwillingness
to acknowledge the errors and defects in works
already executed. These works were, at the time,
executed according to the theories adopted by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>most eminent engineers in the profession, and it
would be considered unprofessional to admit errors.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is scarcely a district (excepting where drains
have been laid within the last three years) where the
branch drains are trapped into the main sewers with
an efficient water-seal. Surveyors feel that to acknowledge
this would be tantamount to acknowledging
a want of professional knowledge or neglect of
duty on their part.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, strictly speaking, this could not be the case,
and a surveyor (placed in such a position where he
knows that there are defects in his drainage system,
and probably these errors were made by himself,)
could say that these now known defects were not
previously known by the most eminent engineers,
and especially with regard to sewer-gas, its treatment,
and action on the public health. Boldly facing the
matter and advocating that the drainage under his
charge should be so perfected that no medical man
could point to it as being detrimental to health, if it
entailed an unusual expenditure, coming from the
surveyor he would carry the Board with him, and
in doing so would make his position at the Board
doubly secure.</p>

<p class='c006'>To prove this we have only to refer to reports
made by engineers during the last fifteen years
on drainage schemes, compare the results of the
theories laid down, and note the instances in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>they have failed, especially those in connection
with sewage farms and the ventilation of sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'>I  will quote a few extracts from these reports:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“No injury to health can possibly take place from
gas issuing from properly constructed gratings fixed
in the middle of the road, and if one is a nuisance,
dig down and put in others until the nuisance is
removed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This has certainly not been the case. You may
dig as many holes as you like, and put in as many
gratings, yet some will be injurious to health.</p>

<p class='c006'>In describing sewage farms, they were described
as being (if adopted) the means of securing a large
revenue to the Local Board by the excellent crops
grown, one engineer stating that persons could walk
through them with as much pleasure as through a
flower or kitchen garden; but practical experience
has proved this to be incorrect: and although these
statements were made in good faith, they have not
been realised.</p>

<p class='c006'>You may regulate the irrigation of a sewage
farm to such a nicety that no odour from the
sewage is perceptible in the district; yet the atmosphere
will contain poisons which will have a very
detrimental effect on the health of those living
there.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a few years after sewage farms have been laid
out, they pay, and you get good crops from them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>but after that the ground becomes so soured that the
farm is almost useless.</p>

<p class='c006'>In face of these facts no surveyor should hesitate
to bring forward known improvements to his Board.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many owners of property have recognised the importance
of adopting the best sanitary measures for
their houses, although in some cases it is only a plea
to let or sell their property. As an instance of this,
some time ago I was in search of a house in the
suburbs, and met with one described as standing on
good gravelly soil, with good drainage and perfect
sanitary arrangements. The builder and owner took
me over the house, and on reaching the kitchen
pointed out with some degree of pride that the
sink was cut off from the drains, and stated that
the drains were constructed on the most “scientific
principles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now although scientific plumbers have done good
work in making our dwellings more healthy, they
have in many cases overdone the matter. The fact
of their displaying conspicuously, on signs and billheads,
“Sanitary work executed on the most scientific
principles,” is not always a guarantee that a
healthy house can be received from their hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the house above referred to, everything to the
eye appeared sound and good, but on the house being
occupied, a disagreeable odour was noticed in the
kitchen, and in some of the lower rooms. The sink-pipe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>which was pointed out by the builder as being
“cut off,” ran from the sink trough without a trap or
water-seal of any kind, and through this pipe, when
the doors were shut, the air was supplied to the building
at the rate of 180 feet per minute. The back
of the W.C. was ventilated from the outside to give
free ventilation to the space under the seat, and
through the ventilators (which were working as inlets)
the air came into the house, which supplied
the bedrooms, passing over the pan, between it and
the seat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The above is an illustration of a house where the
sanitary arrangements were supposed to be on the
most scientific principles! Fresh air being supplied
to bedrooms by passing over the closet-pan, and in
the kitchen and rooms below by passing through a
2-inch sink-pipe. This is one of the many cases that
may be mentioned to show the necessity of testing
any system of drainage and sanitary fittings.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is not an unusual occurrence, as thousands
of similar cases exist, where the principal air supply
passes over sanitary fittings or through apertures
which bring it in contact more or less with decomposed
matter. In a building where a number
of fireplaces exist, a constant current of air is passing
in from the outside, which after mixing with the
air in the building escapes up the chimney. An
ordinary chimney extracts from the room from 60
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to 120 cubic feet of air per minute, thus in a ten-roomed
house you have going out of the chimneys at
least 1000 cubic feet of air per minute. When the
house is closed this large volume of air is drawn
into it through apertures offering the least resistance,
whether it be ventilators in the w.c., kitchen
sinks, or drains in the basement (which traps may
have been siphoned), over sanitary pipes or through
doors and windows. Whichever point offers the
least resistance, there the supply to feed the
chimneys will come.</p>

<p class='c006'>The injurious effects on the health of persons who
occupy buildings that take in their air supply
through unclean apertures are too well known to
those medical men and others who have had experience
in sanitary matters, and it can be only
estimated by results. I could enumerate cases
where the health of the inmates and the death-rate
were conclusive evidence to prove the disastrous
effects produced by air being supplied through such
inlets. One case in particular, which consisted of
eight blocks of buildings planned exactly alike.
The drains were cut off on the outside at the foot
of all soil-pipes, and a second disconnection about
50 feet from the building. In one building the
basement was drained into the branch drain with
a trap in the inside, and from the quantity of water
and soil which flowed through this branch drain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the basement trap was constantly being siphoned,
leaving a 6-inch air supply into the building through
50 feet of drain. This, combined with 200 feet per
minute through the <span class='fss'>W.C.</span>, had the effect of causing
an unusual depression of spirits in the occupants of
this building, and more deaths occurred in this one
block than in the whole of the others.</p>

<p class='c006'>It does not require a large amount of scientific
knowledge to ensure a healthy building. What is
required is sound pipes, the area of them in proportion
to the work they have to do, tight joints, and a knowledge
of ventilation. Nothing must be left to theory.
A pipe either leaks and lets out the soil, or it is sound.
If it is sound, sewage matter can be carried through
it anywhere without the slightest injury to health or
unpleasantness of any kind. Pipes can be ventilated
without traps being siphoned, and the gases from
sewers and soil-pipes treated so as to ensure healthy
buildings at a moderate cost.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a rule, the first intimation of any defect in the
drainage system of a town or the sanitary fittings of
a building is given by the medical officer of health
or the medical attendant of the family, whose attention
has been forcibly drawn to it by the serious
illness of the inmates.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is no unusual occurrence, that after the medical
officer, surveyor, and inspector of nuisances have made
a minute inspection of a building, they leave it without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>discovering defects which exist in pipes carefully
cased over, or in the sanitary fittings.</p>

<p class='c006'>To detect the manner in which poisons from
drains are thrown into a building and inhaled by
the occupants, is oftentimes not an easy matter. In
many cases the drains have been so cut about and
additions made to them, that to trace defects or
even the number of drains which are attached to
the branch drains or sewers, a considerable amount
of excavating is necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>The system described in these pages is intended
to prevent in a measure this excavating, and to
enable a person above the ground to determine the
number, capacity, and state of the drains underneath
the surface, as well as to more readily discover any
imperfections in soil-pipes and sanitary fittings.</p>

<p class='c006'>When sewers are laid to a town or district, it
is the practice of the authorities to let the work by
tender, the lowest tender being oftentimes accepted;
consequently it is in the interest of the contractor
to get the work done as quickly and cheaply as
possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible for the engineer, or clerk of
works, to see the whole of the work done, and the
result is that a large quantity of bricks which form
the sewer are not properly bedded. Liquid sewage
finds its way through the joints of the brickwork and
percolates through the soil, in some cases to a very considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>distance, contaminating the water it mixes
with on its course, and oftentimes it forms a putrid
mass under the basement of buildings which happen
to be of a lower level than the sewers. To prevent
this, a clause should be inserted in the contract that
each length of drain or sewer should be tested by
atmospheric pressure, say 5 lb. to a square inch.</p>

<p class='c006'>The top of the sewer should be as tight as the
bottom to prevent any gas escaping through the
sandy soil or rubble which may be filled in around
the sewers or drains.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaky sewers and badly-jointed pipes under the
soil should never be allowed, yet the danger is not
so great in them as in those pipes laid above the
ground. Joints to these pipes so often leak that
without testing them thoroughly when laid, one
leaky joint would cause an unpleasant odour in a
building for years without its source being discovered.
The reason of this is, that the current of
air passes through buildings in a thousand different
ways. I have known a sickly odour to come from a
cupboard on the first floor of the wing of a building
some 60 feet from any soil-pipe or grating; one case
in particular, that of a nursery cupboard. This
occurred through a leaky soil-pipe from the closet in
the basement of the building.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the planning of the building the chimney
near the cupboard had the greatest draught of air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>in the house, and the air which supplied this
chimney came principally from the basement. The
sewer gas from the leaky joint, being of a heavier
gravity than the atmosphere of the house, was
carried along the floor unobserved to this particular
room, filling at night, when the fire was not burning,
this cupboard, which contained linen, and this held
the impurities given off from the leaky joint in the
pipe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many cases of a similar nature could be mentioned,
where families will never recover the loss
sustained by them through similar leaky joints in
the soil-pipes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Insufficient fall to sewers does not often occur in
those laid under the supervision of engineers, but it
is in the branch drains connected to them where so
many blunders are made. Oftentimes one part of a
drain is laid almost level, whilst another part is laid
with a steep gradient. This facilitates the choking
of drains, and the siphoning of traps.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some persons lay drains from houses to the main
sewer or to branch drains which are altogether out
of proportion to the work they have to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>The smaller the drain is kept the better, but the
diameter should be regulated according to the
quantity of water and soil flowing into it, taking
into consideration the possibility of additional inlets
being added.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The best plan is to collect the number of inlets
or supplies to the drain, compare them with the
gradient to which they are laid, and put in a drain
which, if all the inlets are supplying water at the
same time, would not fill more than nine-tenths of
its area.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases I have seen a 9-inch drain laid
from a house having only two closets, sink and bath
outlet attached. If the whole of these were used at
the same time, the area of the flow into the drain
would only be 7·696 inches, but in the 9-inch drain
the area would be 63·617 inches, or nearly nine
times the size required to carry off the water and
soil.</p>

<p class='c006'>The whole space not occupied by water and soil
is filled with gas, which extracts poisons from sewage
and distributes them at outlets according to the
displacement caused by the water and soil entering
and flowing through the drain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Architects and builders laying drains to houses or
buildings should discard the theories of any persons
who do not keep to this rule: that the smaller the
drain is, the better, providing it does not fill; and the
least quantity of gas there is in the drain, the less
dangerous will be the poison in the gas when discharged
through openings or gratings. The reason
of this is, that in a small drain only a small
quantity of the sewage is exposed to the action of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the gas in transit; whereas in a large drain the
greater portion of the sewage is exposed, thus increasing
its decomposition.</p>

<p class='c006'>When storm water from houses or land enters
drains, great care should be taken to form openings
or inlets near where drains are likely to fill, as the
injurious effects of trap siphoning are of serious
consequence to health.</p>

<p class='c006'>In many cases the construction of new drains and
sewers in a district have been simply a waste of
money as regards improving the health of the
inhabitants, and numerous cases of zymotic disease,
and in some cases an epidemic has occurred where
previously such diseases were almost unknown.
This is caused principally by connecting old drains
(some of which are disused ones and connected
with old cesspits) to the new drains leading to the
sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'>In cesspits and old drains the soil and putrid
matter have been for years allowed to accumulate,
and the poison from such matter, when distributed
into the open air through gratings in the new sewers
or into houses, is, when inhaled into the system, the
cause of these zymotic outbreaks. In tracing these
old drains and in preventing stagnant gases from
remaining in any portion of the drain, the engineer
or architect cannot pay too much attention, as
confined gases when charged with poisons from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>putrid matter are the principal factors in producing
disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many persons place a well-constructed trap
at the inlet, and another some distance along the
drain, say at the end of a building or grounds,
without any ventilation between the two traps. In
fact this used to be a common occurrence; but it
should never be done. If the drain should be a
6-inch one, and the traps 50 feet apart, the amount of
gas between the two traps would average 9 cubic feet,
and this gas would in the ordinary working of the
drain remain for years, getting more poisonous the
longer it remained undisturbed. The owner of the
house, knowing that he had a good trapped drain
connected to sewers, would feel himself safe, and
naturally think his house healthy. Far better for
him if the house were drained into a ventilated cesspit,
as when the gases in the drain became released,
which may occur by the siphoning of the traps at
the house-connection, the danger would be equal to
the emptying of a disused cesspit, and carrying the
contents through the house. The more a person
tests the working of gas in sewers or drains the
more he will find that branch drains from their
construction supply the poisons which render the
gases in the sewers themselves so noxious.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1880, whilst engaged in tracing the course of
an outbreak of typhoid, I made a series of experiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>with a view to trace the source from which
the disease emanated, and every experiment proved
that the origin of the disease lay in the gases
which were in contact with putrid sewage matter,
existing in old drains and cesspits attached to the
sewers as well as in the gases which were confined
between traps. The distribution of the disease was
due to the imperfect construction of the sewers,
drains, and sanitary fittings.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most successful experiment, and the one from
which the greatest result was obtained, and which I
have ever since most successfully used, was in determining
the state, size, and condition of the drains underground,
and also that of the house or buildings,
by measuring by compression the gas contained in the
sewer or sanitary fittings. The principal cause of its
distribution was the compression of the gas between
the water-traps, the siphoning of house-traps leaving
at times a free passage for the gas to enter the
house.</p>

<p class='c006'>The amount of compression or displacement
necessary to force the gas in bulk through the traps
has been accurately measured, to know what quantity
of liquid was required to be thrown into a
drain or sewer of any size to force the gas in bulk
through the water-trap. The lifting power of the
gas on the water by compression was found to be
<span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>300</span></span> part of its bulk. Thus, if a drain perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>sound, and sealed with a water-seal each end, held
300 feet of gas, 1 cubic foot of water thrown into
the drain would force the gas in bulk through the
water-seal.</p>

<p class='c006'>It became evident, that if both ends of any drain
were sealed with a water-trap or otherwise for testing,
the capacity of the drain or leaks of any kind
could be determined without excavating.</p>

<p class='c006'>As it was inconvenient to watch the working of
the drain through the traps, I constructed an instrument
called a detector<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> to observe the working of
the atmosphere in the drain. This instrument, or a
gas-pressure gauge, when attached to the drain, will
denote by the rising of the liquid the amount of
compression in the drain. This, when compared with
the quantity of water thrown into it, will give the
size and capacity of the drain, and will also indicate
any siphoning of traps or leaks which exist in any
of the sanitary fittings of the house.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. This instrument with instructions as to reagents can be obtained
from E. Cetti, Meteorological Instrument Maker, 36, Brooke Street,
Holborn, price 12<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">s.</span></i> 8<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">d.</span></i> It is cheaper and more convenient than

</div>

<p class='c006'>The following table will show the amount of gas
in every 100 feet of circular pipe or drain, from
4 to 30 inches in diameter, also the amount of
water thrown into a trap to produce the necessary

detector or pressure gauge: the quantity being
as near as possible 3⅓ ozs. of water to 1 cubic foot of
gas space.</p>

<p class='c006'>The method of testing drains and fittings by compression
of gas is as follows:—When the drainage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>plan of a building exists, the work of testing by
compression of gas in the drain will be a very
simple matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Plate 1 shows the drains as laid to a semidetached
villa, with two inlets from sinks marked
1, one from bath overflow marked 2, and two from
the soil-pipes of closets in the basement and first-floor
marked 3. The drain from A to B is a 6-inch
stoneware pipe, and its length is 100 feet. The
amount of gas in it would be 19<span class='fraction'>1096<br /><span class='vincula'>1728</span></span> cubic feet.
The branch drains from the other inlets are 4 inches
in diameter, and the collected lengths are 50 feet,
and the quantity of gas in them would be 4<span class='fraction'>627<br /><span class='vincula'>1728</span></span>
cubic feet, giving a total in the whole of the drain
of nearly 24 cubic feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the indiarubber pipe to the detector or pressure
gauge is placed in either of the traps marked 1,
and the glass tube filled with liquid up to the data
line, 5 pints of water poured into either of the traps
marked 1, will produce a rise of 1 inch in the liquid
of the detector, that is if all the drains are clear and
joints tight, the drains being stopped off for testing
at A.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should a trap be fixed anywhere between A and
B a lesser quantity will be required to lift the liquid,
and the position of the trap can be determined by
comparing the exact quantity of water used with
the capacity or quantity of gas in the drain.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>If a trap should be fixed or a stoppage formed in
any part of the drain A B, the flushing of a closet
or sink would, by the compression of the gas, force it
in bulk through the weakest trap, or the one having
the least dip or seal. The quantity which would
pass through would depend on the amount of water
used in the flushing and the fall of the drain.</p>

<p class='c006'>The drains to the building having been tested, and
their defects ascertained, it will be necessary now to
test the soil-pipe.</p>

<p class='c006'>On this plan it is fixed on the outside of the
house, having a trap with an open grating just
beyond the basement closet, and a ventilating pipe
carried above the eaves of the roof. Whether the
soil-pipe be fixed inside or outside of the building it
should be perfectly gas-tight, and in this testing a
person cannot be too particular.</p>

<p class='c006'>In testing the soil-pipe shown on plan, the easiest
method is to put the detector or pressure-gauge at
the grating of the trap 3, placing the indiarubber
tube over the grating, and making a tight joint
with clay. Then close the top of the ventilating
pipe and pour water in the top closet, when, if
the joints are tight, the liquid in the detector will
rise suddenly, and then lower itself as the water
leaves the trap, indicating that the soil-pipe is tight,
but if it is not tight, no rising of the liquid will
take place. Should there be no trap at the bottom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the soil-pipe, it will be necessary to excavate
down to the drain to take out a length of pipe, to
seal the mouth of the drain with clay for testing.
If there should be leaky joints or holes in the soil-pipe,
a little sulphur burnt in the pipe, or a little
pungent essence thrown into it, will clearly denote
where the leaks are.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having tested the soil-pipe and proved it tight,
or effectually stopped all leaks as the case may be,
no gas can be given off in these drains or fittings
except through the ventilators (under ordinary
circumstances) as no trap has been siphoned in
the testing.</p>

<p class='c006'>As before stated, the ventilating pipe runs to the
top of the building of the same diameter as the
soil-pipe, in fact this is a plan of drains to a house
recently built in the suburbs of London, and the
planning of them would be considered perfect by
many sanitary men, but before we testify them as
perfect, let us carefully analyse the working of the
ventilation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ventilating pipe being carried above the roof
is strictly in accordance with the bye-laws of the
Local Board, although it spoils the appearance of
the house. One reason why it was put there is to
prevent the siphoning of the closet trap, and its
height is to carry out the recommendations of
medical writers in the <cite>Lancet</cite> who have so often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>insisted that these tall pipes, carried some feet away
from chimneys or bedroom windows, were necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us test this theory.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will flush the closet by throwing down slops
and giving the closet the regular flush, carefully
testing what takes place. The result is that the
soil-pipe, instead of carrying off the odours from the
top, only forms an air inlet, and 2¼ cubic feet of air
has been sucked in at the top of the pipe, and the
same quantity of gas discharged through the grating.
As this grating on the plan is only 2 feet from the
passage door which leads into the kitchen, the least
that occurs is that a portion enters the house, and
the cook has a slight headache when preparing the
meals for the day.</p>

<p class='c006'>To be more certain of this let us test the working
of the ventilation by a dozen flushings of the closets,
and the same results are obtained by measurement,
27 cubic feet of air entered the top of the pipe, and
has been driven out at the grating below. This
proves that it is unnecessary to spoil the appearance
of our houses by the erection of these pipes, or of
carrying them above the soil-pipe or closet level.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would not be consistent for me here to state
how these unsightly pipes could be avoided, but I
am confident that ere long they will become obsolete,
although they have been erected by thousands in
various parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>We will now test the working of the ventilation
in drains A B, and those in branch drains to traps
marked I. As they are clear, we find that the
gases in them are not so poisonous as in the sewers
to which they are connected.</p>

<p class='c006'>A manhole grating exists in the sewer some
40 yards from the back of the building, and through
this grating the gas which is driven by the flushing
escapes, and its density depends on the nature of
the soil passing in the sewer. Its density is lessened
by diffusion, or the mixing of the gas which takes
place at the grating, but the time it takes for the
gas which is in the drain near the traps I, to mix
with the fresh air at the grating in the street is a
problem that I will leave others to solve. We are
certain that no gas in bulk can pass through the
trap under ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>We can now certify that the drains are tight,
well trapped and ventilated, they are laid strictly
in accordance with the bye-laws of the Local Board,
and we can quote that similar plans were exhibited
last year at the Health Exhibition, as models for
country architects and builders to copy; and ninety-nine
out of every hundred sanitary inspectors would
sign the certificate that the sanitary arrangements
were carefully tested, and found perfect.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Experience in working the detector will not allow
me to do this. Although for months not the
slightest particle of sewer gas has entered the
building, until one evening about eight o’clock a
sickly smell is observed in the kitchen, and this is
attributed to a change in the weather, heavy rain
having fallen during the day, and no notice was
taken of it before retiring to rest. In the morning
the house is unbearable. The inspector of nuisances
is sent for, who cannot detect anything wrong in the
drains. The surveyor to the Local Board visits the
house with the same result, and it is not until the
middle of the day before the nuisance has abated,
its cause still a mystery to the sanitary officials and
to the owner of the house, who is a medical man of
great experience in sanitary matters, and a sanitary
writer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now what really did occur was this. The sewer
at the back nearly filled with water and soil caused
by the heavy rains, and when this was rising, about
2 cubic feet of gas was forced from the drain B
through the grating at the bottom of the soil-pipe.
The junction where the drain at A joined the sewer
was made as usual about two-thirds the height of
the sewer, consequently the drain from A to B filled
some 20 feet during the storm. When the storm
abated, the water leaving the drain at A sucked the
trap at the bottom of the soil-pipe 3. The seal
being gone, the gas from the sewer at once came
through the trap, the current being estimated at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>from 80 to 200 feet per minute; so that the quantity
of gas given off at the trap, which is 2 feet from the
door, would be about 2000 cubic feet from the time
the trap was sucked until it was filled again by the
flushing of the closet.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is by no means an exceptional occurrence,
two similar cases occurred in the suburbs last year.
In one case the owner of the house was seriously ill
for several days, and was for some weeks obliged to
neglect his business and seek a change of air. In
the other case the daughter was taken ill with a
zymotic disease which nearly cost her her life, and it
was months before she regained her strength.</p>

<p class='c006'>The easiest method of preventing this siphoning
of the traps is to fix a small mica valve at the most
convenient part of the drain between A and B, fixing
it above the ground. You can also prevent it as
well as the gas coming near the house by putting in
a trap at A and having an open grating between A
and B. This would not prevent the 2000 cubic feet
of gas before referred to from escaping from the
drains, but would cause it to be discharged some
distance from the house. You would also have
about 23 cubic feet of gas in the drain always
mixing with the atmosphere of the garden at this
point when the traps are full and tight.</p>

<p class='c006'>Plate 2 shows the plan and drains of a hospital
which I tested by this system in 1880. As it
was an old building the testing was somewhat
different to that described in Plate 1.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/plate3.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Plate 3.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>For years a sickly smell was observed in the ward,
and more especially when the heating apparatus
was at work, and it was thought to arise from the
number of bad cases in the ward. A good system
of ventilation was adopted by the introduction of
fresh air through flues which ran under the floor to
the whole length of the building, and in winter the
air was warmed by passing over hot-water pipes in
the flues, and was distributed at various parts of the
ward through open gratings in the floor, with a good
extraction in the roof, which was open to the ward,
but ceiled over the rafters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Double the amount of fresh air was admitted,
warmed, and extracted, with a view to improve the
atmosphere of the building, but with no better
results. I then decided to test the drains which
were shown on the plan of the building as on
Plate 2, the drain marked A B being tested first
by stopping it off and fixing the detector at B.
This being a 9-inch drain pipe and the length
130 feet, gave 57<span class='fraction'>600<br /><span class='vincula'>1728</span></span> cubic feet as the contents of
gas in it. Adding 6 cubic feet for the branch
drain at C, making a total of 63<span class='fraction'>600<br /><span class='vincula'>1728</span></span> cubic feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The amount of water required to be thrown into
the trap A would be 1 gal. 5 pts. 3 ozs. to produce
the necessary pressure of gas in the drain to lift the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>liquid 1 inch in the detector. Instead of taking
1 gal. 5 pts. 3 ozs., it took 7 gals. 6 pts. 9 ozs.,
giving an additional 237 cubic feet of gas space to
be somewhere attached to the drain. This could
not be leaks, if it had been the liquid in the
detector would not have risen at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ground was opened at D, the drain sealed,
and the detector fixed, and the total quantity of
gas in the drain by measurement from the seal to
trap A was found to be 46 cubic feet, and by testing
this was found to be correct, consequently the
additional gas space was between B and D.</p>

<p class='c006'>I particularly noticed that the gases in these drains
were more poisonous than they should have been,
considering the nature of the sewage flowing through
them, and by using a reagent as a liquid in the
detector, its discoloration indicated that the gas was
in contact with a large quantity of putrid matter
which was of a different character to that of the
sewage flowing in the drain.</p>

<p class='c006'>A drain searcher, or pointed rod was used, and
after driving it into the ground a few times, it struck
the large cesspit E, and by the sound given it was
clear that a drain was underneath, when, on excavating,
the old cesspit and drains shown on Plate 3
were discovered, containing more than 60 cubic
yards of black putrid sewage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The junction at F was cut off and the drain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>made good, when a second testing by fixing the
detector at B gave the quantity of gas in the drain
to be 63<span class='fraction'>600<br /><span class='vincula'>1728</span></span> cubic feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cleaning out of 60 cubic yards of sewage and
the removal of the old drains did not in the slightest
degree diminish the nuisance inside the building,
consequently the 15-inch drain on the opposite side
of the building was stopped off at G and H, and in
testing the detector was placed at G. This length
of drain being 140 feet contained 175<span class='fraction'>1098<br /><span class='vincula'>1728</span></span> cubic feet
of gas, and 4 gals. 4 pts. 8 ozs. of water thrown into
the trap H should have lifted the liquid to the
usual height in the detector. This and a similar
quantity of water did not indicate any compression,
but the discoloration of the reagent in the detector
was much quicker than on the drain which was first
tested.</p>

<p class='c006'>The drain was then opened at I, dividing it into
two sections, that from G to I containing 93 cubic
feet. Testing this by 2 gals. 3 pts. 6 ozs. of water
gave the exact rise in the detector, consequently
the leaks and bad gas must be in the section from
I to H. This was tested by a fresh reagent in
the detector, when the speedy discoloration of the
liquid indicated that the source of the poison was
very near.</p>

<p class='c006'>By a few piercings of the ground at K, by the
iron rod or searcher, the drain was found, and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>following the old drain the two cesspits and additional
drains shown in Plate 3 were discovered, and about
150 loads of old putrid sewage had to be excavated
and cleared away. The leaks which prevented the
rise of the liquid in the detector were in the crown
of the old sewage tank M, and the hot-water pipes
of the heating apparatus running in an air-shaft
just over it, the heat extracted the poisons from the
sewage and distributed them into the ward.</p>

<p class='c006'>The connections at K and N having been stopped
up, the drain from I H was again tested, when it
gave 36 cubic feet more gas space than there should
have been in the drain. A few piercings of the soil
at O led to the excavating of those old drains which
are shown attached, and these being excavated and
cleared away, and the connections to drains K, N,
and O being stopped, the drain was again tested
from I to H, when compression in the detector took
place in comparison to the exact quantity of gas
that should be by measurement in the drain.</p>

<p class='c006'>In describing the method of testing drains as
shown on Plates 1, 2, and 3, nothing has been
mentioned as to the level to which branch drains to
houses should be laid, or the method of testing them
to ascertain their fall.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fall given to branch drains should not be less
than 1 in 100, but 1 in 80 is far preferable, and if
the drains are laid to this level, water will flow easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>through them, but should any part be laid out of
a level the water would lay in them and thus give a
less quantity of gas. Then when tested by compression
to the capacity of the drain the lesser
quantity would denote the nature of the dip.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a plan of drains exists, as in the two cases
shown on Plates 1, 2, and 3, the difficulty of testing
them and proving their defects will not be as
great as when no plan has been made. If no plan
has been made or no record kept of them, it is best
to make a rough plan of the building, fixing the
positions of all inlets, their sizes and lengths, of
branches to the drains on the premises, and also to
lay down on the plan the length and size of this
drain to where it reaches the extent of the property
or joins the main sewer, opening the ground for
testing in a similar manner to that described in
Plate 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>In testing pipes or sanitary fittings of any kind,
leaks can be easily found by attaching the detector
or pressure gauge to the most convenient part of
the pipe or fitting, and when everything is sound
care should be taken to flush all inlets at the same
time, to ascertain whether the rush of water has
any effect on the traps or water-seal. If the vibration
in the detector or pressure gauge exceeds 2/10ths
of an inch, a freer gas space must be provided, or the
action of the water checked in some manner. Pipes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>whether sanitary or otherwise, can be tested as to
tightness in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some modification may be necessary in testing
large sewers or the drains of a district, but if the
testing is performed in a similar manner to that
adopted in the above case the condition of the
drains and fittings can be accurately ascertained.
The least pressure or suction on the traps of drains
or fittings will be shown by the vibration of the
liquid in the detector or pressure gauge when the
water passes through the pipes with flushing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The term “bad drains” is not exclusively
confined to those drains that have leaky joints, or
have an insufficient fall, or traps which siphon
during the passage of the water, but may also be
applied to systems of sewers in general. There are
two points in almost every system of drainage that
call for some improvement. The first is having the
inlets at junctions where small drains join sewers
at the side of the sewers. Thousands of traps are
being continually siphoned by this cause as soon
as the water fills the sewer above the inlet of the
branch drain, as this, when filled with water only
a short distance, forces gas through the weakest
trap, and on the water and soil lowering itself in
the sewer, this water acts exactly as the plunger of
a pump and draws the water out of the weakest
trap. This is often the one in the area or basement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of the building, and to avoid this all inlets at
junctions should enter the top of the sewers, not for
the soil to drop down so as to cause the sewers to
silt, but in an oblique direction with the sewage
flow. The second point is in the ventilation of
sewers, which is not an easy subject to handle.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>SEWER VENTILATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The question of ventilation is a very difficult one,
whether it is in connection with sewers or buildings.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ventilation of buildings has received more
attention than that of sewers, excepting within the
last three years.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the ventilation of buildings we have the work
and experience of Mr. Haden, Captain Galton, Dr.
Parkes, Messrs. Howarth, Tobin, Boyle, Banner, and
others, who have not only made the ventilation of
buildings their principal study, but have also spent
large sums of money in carrying out experiments
with a view of getting a system of ventilation
applicable to any building. I have no doubt that
each of the above authorities in house ventilation
would candidly admit that some of the most favourable
experiments they had made, and from which
at the time they expected the greatest results, had,
when they had been practically applied in different
localities and under different circumstances, proved
their worst failures in providing a regular supply of
fresh air to and the extraction of foul air from any
building.</p>

<p class='c006'>If in the ventilation of buildings so many failures
to get a perfect and universal system can be recorded,
it is quite natural that the same will be the case in
the ventilation of sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The most eminent engineers of the present day
will admit that vast improvements must be made in
sewer ventilation before they can say of a district
where a quantity of drains are laid and a large bulk
of sewage matter is carried through them, that the
atmosphere of that district is as pure as that of one
where no drains are laid or where no sewage matter
can be found.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not until 1840 that the question of sewer
ventilation received very much attention, and it is
in the reports to the City Commissioners of Sewers
and to the Metropolitan Board of Works that the
earliest results are recorded.</p>

<p class='c006'>The report of Colonel Hayward to the City
Commissioners of Sewers, dated 18th March, 1858,
contains some of the earliest and most valuable
information as to sewer ventilation.</p>

<p class='c006'>In that report it is stated that, previous to 1830,
“the sewers were ventilated by the gulleys, which
were large open shafts or shoots connected with the
sewers without traps of any description: they were
connected with gratings of large size, the bars of
which were farther apart than those at present in
use; there were no ventilating shafts rising to the
centre of carriageways, nor were there any side
entrances by which access to the sewers could be
had. Whatever ventilation took place therefore
was effected by the gulleys, and if a sewer required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to be cleansed or examined the mode adopted was to
open holes in the centre of carriageways down to
what are technically called manholes, or working
shafts, and perform these operations from these
apertures, the shafts being left open a sufficient
length of time to ensure ventilation before the men
descended, and if there was fear of an accumulation
of gas or mephitic vapour, which sometimes was the
case near the heads of sewers, but at few other
points in them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Complaints of the effluvium from these gulleys
were made before the year 1830, and are stated to
have grown louder and stronger after that date.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we have the first experience and results of
free and open ventilation to sewers. As regards the
number of these gulleys in proportion to the sewers
we have no evidence in these reports, but judging
from their being specified as large open shafts, the
area for the inlet and outlet of air to the sewers
would be if anything greater than that of the present
day. Yet this report states that the ill odours
which escaped from the gulleys, although they
might not be pestilential, became more repulsively
offensive, and the attention of the Commissioners of
Sewers was drawn to the evil, and it was felt that
some remedy or palliative ought to be devised.</p>

<p class='c006'>The means taken to obviate this evil may be
termed the first experiment in sewer ventilation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“A gulley trap was devised and fixed in the Pavement,
Finsbury, in 1834, and in 1840 nine hundred of
the gulleys had been trapped with a view to remedy
the evil, with the following results.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It became apparent even before that number was
fixed, that the sewers were becoming dangerous to
workmen to enter, and the gases generated found
vent by the house drains (then generally untrapped)
into dwellings.”</p>

<p class='c006'>[It is quite evident that the compression of gases
which takes place in the sewers by the rising and
falling of the liquid and sewage flowing in them was
not then known, or this experiment by closing the
gulleys and ventilating the sewers through the house
traps would not have been attempted.</p>

<p class='c006'>At any rate the first experiment in sewer ventilation
in the City cannot be said to have been a
successful one, as it left matters worse than before.]</p>

<p class='c006'>“To obviate this, ventilating shafts connecting
directly with small iron gratings in the centre of
the carriageways were formed: this mode of ventilating
was also first adopted in the City, and the
system of trapping (with numerous modifications in
manner) and ventilating the sewers in the centre of
the carriageways spread through the length of the
metropolis.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Can it be said that this alteration was an improvement
in sewer ventilation?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The noxious or pestilential vapours that were so
repulsive in 1840 when escaping through the gulleys
were not rendered less poisonous by being given off
in the middle of the road or carriageways, but the
constant passing of carriages over the gratings had
the effect of mixing the gases of the sewer more
quickly with the atmosphere of the street. Thus
their noxious qualities were not so much observed,
but the effect of these gases on the public health by
this arrangement has not been as satisfactory as many
imagine.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the carriage traffic is suspended during the
night, the effluvium from these gratings is now similar
to that experienced from the shoots or gulley shafts
in 1830. This opinion is formed by comparing the
report with testings taken at the gratings last year.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last improvement suggested to give a better
system of sewer ventilation in the City is the erection
of shafts at the sides of the buildings where possible.
A resolution was passed last year by the City
Commissioners of Sewers to erect these shafts where
practicable. The effect of this alteration will be to
remove the nuisance from the street and carry it to
a higher level. If it is intended to work these shafts
in conjunction with the open gratings, the effect will
be that in some streets the whole of the gas from the
sewers adjoining will be pouring out of one shaft.
In the summer time its density will be increased by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the friction in the shafts, and the high temperature
of the atmosphere will cause a more rapid decomposition
in the sewage.</p>

<p class='c006'>In low buildings or warehouses there is nothing
to prevent the poisons from the sewers from being
conveyed down the chimneys into the buildings,
and the employés taking a zymotic disease whilst
engaged in their work and at night taking it to
various parts of the suburbs.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is better to let the gas escape at a low level,
where it could be purified when it is a nuisance,
and especially in the case of an epidemic, than discharge
gas with a greater density at a higher level.</p>

<p class='c006'>The General Board of Health in 1848 issued the
following minutes of information with reference to
sewers and house drains—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Make proper provision for the ventilation of
sewers and drains in such a manner that there may
be a free current of air in them in the direction of
the sewage flow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was also recommended “that the stack pipes
should be connected with the sewers without the
intervention of traps, in order to assist the ventilation,
and there should be no trap between the trap at the
inlet and the sewer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This system was found far worse than the open
gulleys or shoots in the City in 1830, as at Croydon
(which was one of the first towns to carry out works
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of sewage under the General Board of Health) no
sooner had the sewers been in use before an outbreak
of fever took place.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Niell Arnott and Mr. T. Page, C.E., were
appointed by the Home Secretary to report on the outbreak
at Croydon, and Mr. Page in his report states—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whenever a water-closet even with the best form
of siphon trap is introduced into a house, it will
be well to provide an escape into the open air.
When several soil-pans or sinks from the apartments
of a large house are discharged into a common soil-pipe
or vertical main, the main should be continued
up to the roof and to the open air, and if practicable
it should be carried near the chimney. Pipe sewers
must also have ample ventilation provided at all
available points. If the air is confined it is most
dangerous when it breaks forth, which sooner or
later it will do, such evils would have been avoided.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is quite evident by these remarks that the
system of ventilating the City sewers in 1830 was
more perfect than at Croydon, and had Mr. Page
tested the sewers and sanitary fittings by the compression
of gases in them, he would have found that
the action of the water in the pipe prevented the
gas from being confined.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1858, Mr. Goldsworthy Gurney made experiments
in the neighbourhood of the House of
Commons by connecting a number of the sewers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>near with the furnace of the clock-tower, and this
was reported on by Sir Joseph Bazalgette as follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I find that the furnace of the clock-tower of the
House of Parliament was supposed to have been connected
with the adjoining district to the extent of
about a quarter of a square mile, and with about
6½ miles of sewers, but that the ventilation had
in reality been intercepted by a flap so that the
benefit supposed to be derived therefrom was purely
imaginary. Having come to that conclusion, the
next thing I directed my attention to was, supposing
the whole of the air extracted by that furnace was
produced from the sewers, and supposing that all the
intermediate channels could be stopped, and that it
could be directed from the most remote ends of each
of the sewers, and distributed over those sewers with
the most perfect theoretical accuracy, so as to have
uniform currents passing through each of the sewers
towards that chimney, still the effect on those sewers
would be nothing, and the way in which I prove my
statement is this: the total area of the 6½ miles of
sewers now connected with the furnace is 713 feet,
the total area of the channel through which the air
has to be brought from them is 8 feet, that is about
the ninetieth part of 713; the air was passing at
the rate of 542 feet per minute through the 8 feet
area. Therefore, if I could divide that over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>whole district, the velocity in all those sewers would
be 6 feet per minute or ⅕ of a mile per hour.
But we have shown already that there exist in the
sewers from other causes velocities amounting to
100 feet per minute and upwards; and 6 feet per
minute is practically speaking stagnation and not
ventilation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This experiment was undoubtedly one that if it
had been continued (instead of being abandoned),
and the errors corrected, would have led to a more
practical result. The area of the air space to the furnace
was 8 feet, and the current 542 feet, or equal to
6 miles an hour. If this current had been the same
in the sewers as in the channel, the suction produced
on the water-traps of the small drains attached
would lift the water in each trap a little more than
3 inches. But as the ordinary trap has only an
average 2-inch dip, the weakest would have been at
once sucked and the experiment a failure. Had the
dips of the traps been 4 inches, the drains would
have remained sealed except at the intended inlets.
The air being supplied at the ends would have gone
through the sewers without breaking the water-seal,
providing that the air space between the crown of
the sewer and the sewage was not in any way
blocked. If the current in the sewers had been
less than 200 feet per minute, the ordinary trap
would have effectually sealed the various inlets.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Had the average area of gas space above the sewage
been 8 feet, the whole of the 6½ miles of sewers
would have been emptied of its gas and supplied
with fresh air in about an hour. The different areas
should not have been considered, but the total quantity
of gas taken.</p>

<p class='c006'>The velocities of 100 feet here mentioned, is accounted
for as follows. Should the sewage in any
part of the sewers lower itself, causing an additional
gas space in that part of the sewer, the rush of gas
in the sewer to fill the space would cause this 100
feet per minute current.</p>

<p class='c006'>These hitherto unaccountable currents in sewers
and drains are produced by the variation of the gas
space above the sewage, the result of water being
thrown in at the various inlets.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gases of a sewer may be passing backward
and forward in currents varying from 100 to 300
feet per minute, and not any ventilation would take
place except at the gratings, and this would be very
little indeed when the gas in the sewer was of a
heavier gravity than the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c006'>Speaking on the same subject, Colonel Haywood
says, “a down draught so complete as to be superior
to the diffusive power of the gases, you cannot start
with a velocity of less than 2 miles an hour, and suppose
the whole district has been so arranged as to have
a sufficient exhaustive power, the mere opening of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>a water-closet, or the enlarging or the putting in of
a new drain into a sewer, or the making of a hole a
foot square, or a servant taking up a bell trap in a
sink, or a sewer-man lifting a side entrance covering,
would very much destroy the power of the furnace,
and unless you had a gigantic power sufficient to
guard against these casualties the system could only
be a failure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>What is here meant is, suppose that if the
whole of the 6½ miles of sewers were emptied of
their gas at a velocity of 2 miles an hour, the poisons
from the sewage would not be noticeable or injurious
in the atmosphere of the drain. If each inlet to the
sewer was trapped, the opening of a water-closet or
the opening of a bell trap in the sink would not have
affected the 2 miles an hour current in the sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Had the currents in the sewers near the furnace
of the clock-tower been kept at 2 miles an
hour, the traps being tight, and attention been paid
to the compression of the gases in the sewers by the
water entering them, the experiment would have
been in a measure a successful one.</p>

<p class='c006'>From 1855 to 1872, Sir R. Rawlinson, C.B.,
Dr. A. Miller, and Sir Joseph Bazalgette were
carrying out experiments with charcoal trays and
screens, and a committee of the Metropolitan Board
of Works in their report, say:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The results were sufficiently favourable to warrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the use of charcoal ventilators in connection
with such air-shafts as were sources of annoyance
and complaint, but their adoption had also the effect
of diminishing the upward current of foul air through
the shafts and of confining it to the sewers, thereby
endangering the safety of the men working in them,
so that it is necessary that such ventilators should
be cautiously and not generally applied.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These experiments in sewer ventilation were the
most valuable of any yet made to solve the question,
but their failure could be attributed to the following
results.</p>

<p class='c006'>The working of charcoal in the extraction of
poisons given off from sewage in its transit through
the sewers, and which poisons become mixed with
the gas, and the placing of charcoal in layers or
baskets so that the gas should pass through the
interstices of the charcoal, is without a doubt the
best method of dealing with charcoal as an agent
in arresting or picking up the poisons from putrid
matter which is contained in the gas. But the
obstacle this gives to the supply or exhaust of air to
the sewer is greater than the power of the water-trap:
consequently traps are sucked or forced, and the inlet
of fresh air takes place through them into the sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gas from the sewer escapes through the
weakest trap into the house, thus nullifying the
effects of the charcoal trays and rendering them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>almost useless. The passing of the gas over the
tray would prevent this, but experiments prove that
charcoal has not the power to attract and retain the
poisons from the sewage, and which is retained in
the gas. Thus these poisons pass over the charcoal
through the grating into the street.</p>

<p class='c006'>These experiments prove that if the poisons from
the gas are extracted at the outlets, and the drains
into sewers trapped with a water-seal, and the
siphoning or forcing of traps are prevented, sewers
can be ventilated without being a nuisance or prejudicial
to health. But it must be borne in mind
that the instant the current of air in sewers, drains,
soil-pipes, or sanitary fittings exceeds a velocity of
3 miles an hour, even if they have open ends, no
trap with a 2-inch seal is safe from being siphoned.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many surveyors state that sewer gas is uncontrollable.
This is an error. The gases of a sewer are
as controllable as the atmosphere of a room. It is
the compression of the gas caused by an increase of
water in the drain, and the temperature of the
atmosphere on the surface of the ground at the
various points where the gratings are fixed, which
makes the currents of gas in drains so uncertain.
The sudden lowering of the sewage in a drain will
stop the nearest gratings or shaft from working as
inlets.</p>

<p class='c006'>What led engineers to form this opinion was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>failure of experiments with motive power to get
certain results in ventilating sewers, the same as in
a building. It is impossible to get ventilation to
sewers through open gratings except the inlets from
the house drains are sealed with a water-seal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The unsatisfactory results obtained from many
experiments in sewer ventilation have not been the
fault of the plan or the appliances used, but arose
from the wretched manner in which house drains
have been connected to the sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall never forget the testing of some sewers
with a view of improving the ventilation of them.
They were public sewers and almost new ones, and
as far as the sewers themselves were concerned you
could not have had better, both as regards a good
fall and tight joints. But the manner in which the
connections were made to them was something
astonishing. Untrapped gulleys at the sides of the
streets, drains from the sewers into the kitchens of
houses without a single trap. In some cases two or
more traps were fixed according to the whim of the
owner of the house. Rain-water pipes from the
flats of windows on the ground floor were connected
to sewers without traps, closets with no ventilating
pipes, and a dozen other imperfections were found
on the branch drains and fittings.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before completing the tests of these drains and
fittings, I suggested that all faults and errors found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>in connection with the branch drains should at once
be remedied, and each drain be connected to the
sewer with a trap, or else it would be of little use
to improve the ventilation of the sewers. I was
quietly informed that this could not for one moment
be entertained, as where these evils were the worst
was on property belonging to members of the Local
Board, and any attempt to pass a resolution to
compel this to be done would be futile, and the
necessity of doing it attributed to the zeal of local
sanitarians.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am glad to say that cases like this are exceptional,
but there are many towns where similar evils
will remain until an epidemic breaks out and the
authorities are compelled to have them remedied.
The amount of air passing through the sewer is no
indication of the ventilation or the amount of air
that is being admitted, or the quantity of gas
charged with poisons that is given off. I have
tested the gas in a sewer and at the ventilating
shafts, and have repeatedly found the gas in the
sewer flowing at a high velocity whilst the air in the
open ventilating shaft was perfectly stagnant.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have not been able to make experiments to
know how long gas will remain in a sewer, but from
observations of its gravity and working in different
localities I believe that the poisons from sewage
matter are retained in the lower strata of the air of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>sewers in some cases for months, and when open
gratings are only 50 yards apart. The quantity of
air taken in at the gratings at this time is a little
more than the displacement caused by the water, and
when gases are released to any extent it is through
atmospheric influences.</p>

<p class='c006'>If you measure the amount of air going in and
out of say twenty open gratings in the same locality,
the small quantity would astonish those who had
not previously tested it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Repeatedly has it been written and said that if
you put a shaft or grating at the top of a hill, or
sewer, it will take off the impure gas of a district,
but I have had men working for days at the top of
a sewer 150 and 200 feet higher than the lowest
grating, and no trap intervening, yet during this time
not a particle of gas left the drain at this the highest
opening, but at times a good inlet current would
take place down the drain.</p>

<p class='c006'>I find that one of the most fatal mistakes to
make in sewer ventilation is to introduce a large
quantity of fresh air into a sewer at a high temperature.
An atmosphere at from 90° to 100° thrown into
a sewer will rapidly decompose sewage matter and
produce results exactly opposite to that intended.
It is when the hot atmosphere of a summer’s day
comes in contact with the sewage in the sewers that
the worst poisons are generated and given off, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the gases which come from the gratings are the
most noxious. This rapid decomposition is more
particularly felt in the suburbs, where the drains are
of stoneware and the sewage has to be carried through
them for a considerable distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Common sense teaches us that all matter of a
nature like that passing through sewers will decompose
more rapidly and reach a higher state of putrefaction
in an atmosphere of a high temperature,
even above ground, than in any other condition.
Experiments confirm this to be the case whether it
be applied to matter in sewers, vaults, or tanks.
The best experiments that I have made in sewer
ventilation is in keeping the temperature as low as
possible, admitting into the sewer sufficient air to
prevent any action taking place on the water-seal,
and what gas came out of the sewer by compression
to purify it at the gratings, extracting the poisons
that it had taken up from the sewage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many gases which are found in sewers have an
affinity to water, and will make their way to the
water-seal and become absorbed in the water of the
trap to some extent, but not to the extent many
persons imagine, or to become detrimental to health.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a disinfectant having a greater attractive
power than the water is used in connection with the
ventilation, this attraction to the water-seal will not
take place.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>If necessary, in hot weather or in large sewers, or
those of an easy gradient, cold air of a very low
temperature could be introduced, which would prevent
decomposition taking place to any extent
during the transit of the sewage. If the whole area
of a system of sewers was charged four times a day
with air at a temperature of 30° we should have no
complaints of sewer gas.</p>

<p class='c006'>The details of such plans would be out of place
here as they are the subject matter of several patents,
but sewage can be carried through districts without
its gases being injurious to health or without sewage
being subjected to rapid decomposition almost as
easily as meat is now transmitted from New Zealand
to England without any decomposition taking place
during its transit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before leaving the question of sewer ventilation it
will be well to note the results obtained by the valuable
experiments I have quoted, and which have been
made from time to time by the City Commissioners
and the Metropolitan Board of Works. One cause
of the failure of these experiments has been conclusively
proved to be due to the wretched condition
of branch drains and house connections attached to
the sewers on which the experiments were made, and
these are in a measure out of the control of the
officers of these Boards; and until a proper survey of
branch drains and house connections has been made,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and traps placed in proper positions, the ventilation
of these sewers will be almost as imperfect as in 1830.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sanitary survey which is now being made in
this country by the Local Government Board will
fail in one of its most important objects unless it
insists on every surveyor knowing the condition of
drains under the surface of the ground. A cursory
glance at the plans of a district, or a surface
sanitary survey will not do very much in arresting
zymotic disease, and the staff stated to be employed
on this survey is totally inadequate for the
work.</p>

<p class='c006'>To successfully deal with sewer ventilation it
should be divided into two sections: (<em>a</em>) That of the
sewers and branch drains which are directly under
the control of the officers of the various Boards,
(<em>b</em>) Those drains immediately attached to houses,
including the soil-pipes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The necessity for ventilating a sewer is, that in an
unventilated sewer or drain the instant a compression
of the air in a sewer, between the sewage and
crown of the sewer, takes place to <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>300</span></span> part of its
bulk, gas is forced through the weakest trap according
to the displacement of water, and as the water
is lowering in the drain fresh air will be admitted
into the drain through this trap. Thus if a drain or
sewer is not ventilated it will ventilate itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should a sewer be ventilated with open gratings in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the centre of the roads, the placing of gratings at a
moderate distance apart would diffuse the gas
equally in a flat district if the temperature on the
surface of the ground at each grating were the same,
but the variation of the temperature in streets
is such that the heat of the street at one grating
will be a sufficient motive power to extract the gas
from many sewers through this one grating, the
others only forming inlets while the increased heat
lasts.</p>

<p class='c006'>In hilly districts, where the drains are of
necessity of a steep gradient, the quick flow of the
sewage will cause the gas to pass more rapidly when
much sewage is flowing in the drain, the worst gas
coming out at the lowest grating, generally a grating
before a junction, or where two drains meet of
different gradients: but when scarcely any sewage
is flowing, the gas will flow to the highest grating.
Thus, in putting gratings on steep gradients (if no
method of purifying the gas is used), the gratings
should not be placed in regular distances apart, but
where the gas can be discharged in the most open
space.</p>

<p class='c006'>In hot weather, although ten times the amount of
air passes through sewers of steep gradient than in a
flat district, the gases from sewers on a steep gradient
are far the most noxious. If open gratings only are
used on a system of sewers, the gas but not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>sewage should be trapped off into districts, not
only as the means of preventing the gas rushing in
volumes to certain points, but for preventing germs
of disease travelling in the gas of a sewer from an
unhealthy to a healthy district, which is the case
under the present system, by leaving sewers for
miles without any gas check.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have in sewers and drains a power created
by the influx of the sewage which is greater than
any mechanical means that can be used in the
ventilation of them, and it is to get the best method
of applying this power that sanitary engineers must
direct their attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>The difficulties that are met with in ventilating
sewers with open gratings are so great, that I am
convinced that as soon as engineers study the question
more fully, the system will be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The method of carrying off the soil by water
through sewers has proved a good and convenient
one, and scarcely any defect can be found in any
drainage scheme except that of the ventilation, which
is at present one that is condemned by the inhabitants
of most towns as a nuisance, especially in hot
weather, and by the medical profession as being most
prejudicial to health.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a remedy for this, we must profit by the experience
of the early experiments I have quoted, which
points conclusively to the fact that if we extract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>from the gas (which by compression must of necessity
leave the sewers at openings) the noxious and
disease-producing poisons contained in it, at the
gratings, and by those means prevent a rapid decomposition
of the sewage taking place, and without
putting any undue pressure on the water-seals to
houses, we have overcome the greatest difficulty in
the work.</p>

<p class='c006'>In old drains or sewers it will be the work of some
time for the surveyor to know that each drain from
the house to the main sewer is trapped with a good
water-seal, yet this is the most important factor in
providing good ventilation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some persons have hastily condemned the water-trap,
having found out that they have been siphoned
by the transit of the sewage. This is a mistake. A
properly constructed water-seal or trap that clears
itself at each flushing is the best seal for sewer gas.
It will not keep out gas if it is forced in bulk by
excessive pressure, any more than coal gas can be
kept out of houses if a greater pressure is put on
at the works than the resistance of the trap in the
chandelier. In manufacturing gas, either experimentally
or otherwise, water is the seal always used,
but we do not attach anything to break that seal
when dealing with gas for illuminating purposes,
the same as is done in many cases with sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where new drains are laid, no difficulty in getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a good seal to branch drains need be experienced,
and no drain from the house to sewers should be
laid without its being completely disconnected or
cut off as near the soil-pipe as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>In dealing with the ventilation of soil-pipes or
vertical drains, many improvements can in future be
made. The idea of carrying tall ventilating pipes to
the tops of houses was to carry off gas that was
forced in bulk through the trap at the bottom of the
soil-pipe from the sewer, but in well-laid drains this
should never occur. If the drain be disconnected it
would leave at the point of disconnection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The velocity of the water rushing down the pipe,
as proved in the previous chapter on drain testing,
carries the gas out at the bottom of the pipe, the
top of the pipe forming the inlet when odours are
given off from the passing soil, but as soon as the
flushing is over a return current takes place and
fresh air ascends the pipe.</p>

<p class='c006'>If you do not use any method of purifying the gas
which escapes through the pipe, the best plan is to
have the pipe as open as possible at the top and
bottom, and at all bends, for ventilation. These
openings need only be just above the level of the
water flow to prevent splashing, and by following
this rule those unsightly pipes (which give buildings
more the appearance of a distillery or chemical
works rather than a dwelling-house or home) can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>avoided and erected so as to form one of the ornaments
in the architecture of the building.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is at present too much theory in sewer
ventilation, without paying any attention to results
gained, or to the laws which control the atmosphere
and its action on sewage matter.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE ORIGIN AND TRANSMISSION OF ZYMOTIC DISEASE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Whilst making experiments and taking observations
five years ago, to trace the origin and transmission
of some cases of zymotic disease, I formed an
opinion that the theory as regards the transmission
of zymotic disease by contagion was to a certain
extent an erroneous one.</p>

<p class='c006'>I mentioned this to some of my medical acquaintances
at the time, but as it was so opposite to the
prevailing ideas, I was advised not to publish or
hold out such opinions, as they were contrary to the
theories accepted by the medical profession.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now that these theories have been severely shaken,
and in many cases reversed by medical men themselves,
during the past year, I shall plead no excuse,
but insert them for the guidance of those engaged in
sanitary work.</p>

<p class='c006'>The source of zymotic diseases may be traced to
persons inhaling or taking into the system poisons
from putrid sewage matter, and those poisons are
conveyed into the body, either in the food they eat,
the water they drink, or the air they breathe.
Whether they are organic or inorganic, they poison
the blood, which becomes more or less diseased,
according to their density or vitality, or whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>each of the zymotic diseases is produced by distinct
organic germs grown and developed from
putrid matter under different atmospheric influences,
it matters not to my mind in proving the true method
by which zymotic diseases are transmitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the origin or source from which these diseases
are produced, I do not think there are two opinions,
viz. that of poisons from putrid matter, and the question
to be solved is in what manner these poisons
are conveyed into the system. To do this it will be
necessary to quote some cases of zymotic disease
and the circumstances which surrounded them.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a small district, a girl thirteen years of age was
taken with diphtheria, and in two days after the
younger brother was taken and the other children
appeared sickly. From investigation it was certain
that the poison had not been conveyed into the system
by food or water. The children generally took their
meals in the kitchen, the door of which opened into
the yard, which was about 10 feet long by 8 feet wide,
in the corner of which was the <span class='fss'>W.C.</span> I tested the
atmosphere entering the room at the bottom of the
doorway, and found that it contained poisonous
matter, and on testing the closet and drains I found
a hole 3 inches by ¼ inch in the closet trap. Here
was the source of poison which produced the disease.
The gas in the drain was confined between two traps
and in contact with putrid sewage matter, and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>it was removed no poison from any other source
could be detected. The first child that was taken
ill died, but the other recovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it is quite evident that the second child did
not take the disease from the first, as it had not time
to develop. The atmosphere of the room and the
breath of the child were not as poisonous as the
atmosphere of the kitchen in a line between the
kitchen fire and the door, and it was on this line
both children sat at their meals, and thus inhaled
the poison with their food. Had the gases in the
other drains of the district been of the same density
as in this one, and similar leaks existed in the
sanitary fittings, diphtheria would have spread, and by
the popular theory its transmission would have been
attributed to contagion from this family, which in
face of the above facts would have been incorrect.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another case. In a large town diphtheria broke
out, and some hundreds were attacked and over two
hundred died. The source of the disease was not in
the food or water, and the only disease-producing
poison that could be found was in the gas issuing
from the sewer gratings and sanitary fittings.
Schools were closed and the usual remedies used
to prevent contagion, but all to no purpose. The
sewers being of an easy gradient had silted,
forming at intervals masses of putrid matter, and in
the best houses, where the disease was most prevalent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>poisons from the sewers were laid on to them
by the badly-constructed drains and sanitary fittings.
The authorities at last took the matter vigorously
in hand, cleansed and sweetened the sewers as much
as possible, and then the disease abated and died
out. Had contagion been the means by which the
disease was transmitted, it would have continued as
it existed in the town under almost every kind of
atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here we have evidence showing that putrid
matter did exist from which poisons were given off
and their mode of transit into the body, but not
the slightest evidence to prove the poison passed
direct from one person to another.</p>

<p class='c006'>These poisons in the gas can be destroyed by
washing the gas in a chemical solution on leaving
the grating, and since this has been done medical
men have cured the disease by washing the throat
in a similar solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Numbers of typhoid cases could be mentioned
where poisons from putrid matter were conveyed into
the system by water, milk, and impure food, but I
have never heard of a case where the poison was
detected leaving one person for another.</p>

<p class='c006'>If in 1883 a person had stated that cholera was
not contagious, they would have been ridiculed, yet
the principal physician and those in charge of the
cholera hospitals of Paris last year, certified to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>representative of one of our daily papers that cholera
was not contagious. The cholera epidemic of last
year proves that cholera poisons are produced by
heat and atmospheric influences on putrid matter,
and circumstances favour the theory that they are
inorganic, and when inhaled into the system poison
the organisms of the blood to such an extent as to
produce the disease. Cases of cholera broke out in
different parts of the Continent at the same date,
clearly showing that contagion had nothing to do
with producing or transmitting the disease. In
England our ports were jealously watched to prevent
any case from being landed. Had a case been
landed, the excreta from that one case might, when
mixed with the sewage of a large town, have been
the means of spreading the disease through the
whole district, as miles of sewers are so laid that
poisons in the gases can be effectually distributed
through the district in a very short time. Open
ventilation to sewers would greatly assist this, and
especially when the gases in the drains and the fresh
air admitted into them were of a high temperature.
It is very improbable that cases if imported would
break out in two towns at the same time, or that the
poison could be conveyed in the atmosphere which
divides us from the Continent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fortunately, when the continental outbreak was
known, the authorities in the metropolis and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>towns used disinfectants on all known putrid matter,
and especially at the sewer gratings. This was an
expensive process, but it had the effect of preventing
the atmospheric influences (which were similar to
those on the Continent) from developing the poison
to a vitality necessary to give the disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be an excellent preventive if the authorities
of towns would thoroughly examine every
part of their districts, and know for a certainty
whether in their sewers, cesspits, vaults, or dust-bins
there existed putrid matter, or gases from them
similar to those which produced the disease on the
Continent. The expense of such an examination and
for remedying the evils cannot be an excuse for not
doing this work, as the monetary loss experienced by
the residents of those continental towns and cities by
the outbreak was enormous. What the loss would
be to the residents of the metropolis if a cholera
epidemic were to occur, it is difficult to imagine, and
yet in many of the districts cholera-producing
elements exist from which in all probability the
heat and atmospheric influences experienced during
several weeks of excessive dry weather during the
summer months will produce poisons of a similar
vitality to those produced on the Continent during
the past year.</p>

<p class='c006'>Previous to the cholera epidemic, small-pox was
very prevalent in London, and I very carefully noted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the cases as they were reported, and visited the
districts where the disease was most prevalent, for
the purpose of testing the nature of the gases in the
sewers, and observing how the sewers and sanitary
fittings were constructed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In many of these districts, and especially those of
Homerton, Hackney, Bow, and Bromley, the drains
are so laid and the fittings so constructed that a
supply of sewer gas is pumped into the houses, and
it is impossible for persons to live in the houses of
these districts without inhaling gases that have been
for a long time in contact with sewage matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whether the small-pox poison is an organic one
(which I believe it is), and is produced from a collection
of matter in a high state of decomposition, with
or without being mixed with the excreta of persons
suffering from the disease, or whether it is of an
inorganic nature, the poison is derived from this
source rather than from the impurities thrown off
through the skin of persons suffering from the
disease. As a proof of this, as soon as the cholera
broke out last year on the Continent, almost every
gulley and grating in the metropolis where sewer
gas passes was charged more or less with a disinfectant,
which minimised the poison in the gas.
The result was that small-pox abated in an epidemic
form although the temperature of the atmosphere
increased.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The disinfectants so placed could not, naturally,
affect the gas in branch drains to houses, or putrid
matter in various parts of the sewers, or if it had,
judging from its beneficial effects at the outlets,
small-pox would have disappeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>If contagion were the means by which this disease
was distributed, disinfectants at sewer gratings would
not have prevented the disease continuing in an
epidemic form.</p>

<p class='c006'>Take the adjoining districts of Fulham and
Putney. During the epidemic, the gases from the
sewer gratings in the Fulham district were more
dense than those at Putney. Fulham had many
cases of small-pox, but Putney none, although persons
from each district were in daily contact with
each other; but the houses were not connected by
the same system of sewers.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must not be thought that I wish to advance the
theories of the anti-vaccinationist. I have had my
children vaccinated because it is the law, and in the
opinion of medical men a preventive against the
disease, but viewing the change of medical opinion
with reference to cholera during last year, and comparing
tests and observations that have been made,
they will soon be convinced that vaccination is a
futile remedy to use with a view of stamping out
the disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>At present the question is (with medical men) one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of theory, but ere long I am certain that they will
take a more practical view of the case and definitely
fix the origin of this disease and its distribution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Previous to vaccination being introduced, putrid
matter in vaults, cesspits, and drains was allowed
to reach a higher state of putrefaction, and thus the
poisons from them became more virulent and produced
the disease of a more virulent type.</p>

<p class='c006'>If modern systems of drainage and sanitary
arrangements were the means of preventing this
high state of putrefaction, and of reducing the
disease to a milder form, perfecting these arrangements
should be the means of stamping it out
altogether and rendering vaccination useless.</p>

<p class='c006'>Unless it can be proved that poisons given off
through the skin and from the lungs of persons
suffering from the disease are as virulent as those
from putrid matter alone, or from the excreta from
those suffering from the disease, the theory of
contagion<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> cannot be entertained.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The word contagion as here used is not intended to apply
to cases where persons not affected sleep in the same bed, or
wear the same clothes, or handle things from, or persons suffering
from this disease, as this would be inoculation.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Many medical men will say that the facts to prove
that small-pox is transmitted by contagion are so
positive that there is no chance of disputing them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us examine two cases to support this theory.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Small-pox is prevalent, say, in the north of London;
a man is in business there from seven to eight hours
each day, but his home is in the S.W. district. He
is taken ill, and remains at home, calling in his
medical attendant, who on his second visit pronounces
it a case of small-pox, and orders his removal to the
hospital. In a few days other members of the
family are taken and removed, and similar cases
occur in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c006'>The theory of the medical man would be that his
first patient had contracted his disease in his place
of business in the N.W. district and had conveyed
it to the S.W. district, distributing it in the neighbourhood
in which he lived. This is only theory,
and the only thing the medical man has to rely on
to prove his case is, that the man first taken was
engaged three-fourths of each day where small-pox
was prevalent. Against this theory, assume that
the disease originated by the whole of these persons
inhaling poisons from putrid matter in their own
locality or at their own doors, or in their homes,
but that the atmospheric influences to develop the
poison was a few days longer completing its work in
the S.W. district than in the north. Then test the
sanitary conditions of both localities, and you will
find similar matter producing poisons. These are
facts that will support this view of the case, as well
as the following evidence which cannot be contradicted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>When sewage matter is allowed to remain
in bulk undisturbed, and in connection with a
system of sewers, it forms retorts for the generation
of these poisons, and they are conveyed for miles
in drains by atmospheric and other influences; and
where these people lived the gases would probably
be discharged with a greater facility than at any
other point.</p>

<p class='c006'>Take another case. A man leaves London for the
country, and a day or two after his arrival he is
taken ill with small-pox. There is no system of
drains to the house in which he is located. People
living in this and other houses are affected with
the disease, and the medical officer of health in his
report states that the disease was conveyed from
London to the district by this man. He was
certainly the first one affected, and at first sight
this case appears to be conclusive in favour of
contagion, for if he did not contract the disease in
London and bring it into the country how was it
that he was first affected?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is certain that putrid matter from which the
poisons are derived exists in villages similar to that
in towns, consequently the poisons are there, and
medical men agree that when a person leaves one
locality for another, for what is commonly called a
change of air, the system undergoes a change. This
change had such an effect on the system of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>man that the poison from the putrid matter of the
village had a greater effect on him and poisoned the
blood more quickly, than on those who were inhaling
the poison during its various stages of development:
but when it was fully developed by atmospheric
influences the disease appeared in those other
persons who were in contact with the poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of sewer poison on the system is
similar to that experienced by persons taking cold.
Persons occupied in rooms which have an equal
temperature, or are not subjected to cold chilly
winds, take colds and contract all sorts of complaints
on being exposed to currents of cold air even for
a short time. The draught from a window only,
when a cold stream of air is playing upon it,
will do this: the blood is chilled, hence the cold,
fever, or one of the many complaints follow; but on
persons used to exposure it has no effect. In the
same way sewer poisons act on those who suddenly
inhale them, only the blood becomes poisoned
instead of chilled; but on those who are in constant
contact with them they have not such an effect,
yet on these persons the effect of them can be traced.</p>

<p class='c006'>The medical profession have hitherto placed too
much reliance on isolation as the sole means of
stamping out this disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Metropolitan Asylums Board have had ample
means at their disposal since 1867 to test the soundness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of this theory, yet after spending something
like 480,000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> per annum, small-pox has increased
100 per cent. since that date! This fact alone is
sufficient evidence to prove that other means than
those of isolation must be used to effectually stamp
out this disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is of little use to have elaborate arrangements
in hospitals and camps to minimise the effects on
persons who have taken the disease, and at the same
time allow the source from which it emanates to
remain undisturbed. I admit that it is a question
too complicated to be exhaustively dealt with in a
work on the testing of drains and sanitary fittings,
but it is inserted to show what a power those who
are engaged in designing or executing sanitary
works hold for good or evil in affecting the health
of the community.</p>

<p class='c006'>Experience proves that ninety-nine zymotic cases
out of every hundred are caused through imperfect
sanitary works and appliances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c006'>This work is not, in any sense, an elementary treatise, or history of the steam engine, but
is intended to describe examples of Fixed Steam Engines without entering into the wide
domain of locomotive or marine practice. To this end illustrations will be given of the most
recent arrangements of Horizontal, Vertical, Beam, Pumping, Winding, Portable, Semi-portable,
Corliss, Allen, Compound, and other similar Engines, by the most eminent Firms in
Great Britain and America. The laws relating to the action and precautions to be observed
in the construction of the various details, such as Cylinders, Pistons, Piston-rods, Connecting-rods,
Cross-heads, Motion-blocks, Eccentrics, Simple, Expansion, Balanced, and Equilibrium
Slide-valves, and Valve-gearing will be minutely dealt with. In this connection will be found
articles upon the Velocity of Reciprocating Parts and the Mode of Applying the Indicator,
Heat and Expansion of Steam Governors, and the like. It is the writer’s desire to draw
illustrations from every possible source, and give only those rules that present practice deems
correct.</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
